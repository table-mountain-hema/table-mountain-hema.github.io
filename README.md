# South African Table Mountain Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) Group

Welcome to the official repository for the South African Table Mountain Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) Group. We are dedicated to the study, practice, and promotion of traditional European martial arts in South Africa. Our group brings together enthusiasts of all levels interested in the rich history and dynamic practice of historical fencing and martial arts from the medieval and Renaissance periods.

## About Us

Our HEMA group is based in Stellenbosch, Western Cape, and we offer regular training sessions, workshops, and seminars focused on various aspects of historical European martial arts. From longsword fencing techniques inspired by the German and Italian masters such as Johannes Liechtenauer, Joachim Meyer, Hans Talhoffer and Fiore dei Liberi to the intricate art of rapier dueling, cloak and dagger and other interesting techniques taught by masters such as Ridolfo Capo Ferro. Our community is passionate about reviving these ancient practices whilst interpreting them through a modern lens.

## Training Sessions

We host weekly training sessions that cover a wide range of HEMA disciplines, including:
- **Longsword**: Learn the art of the two-handed longsword, following the teachings of historical masters like Johannes Liechtenauer and Fiore dei Liberi.
- **Rapier**: Explore the elegance and precision of Renaissance rapier fencing, drawing on the Italian and Spanish traditions.
- **Sword and Buckler**: Discover the techniques of fighting with a sword and buckler, based on the I.33 manuscript, the oldest known fencing manual.
- **Armored Combat**: For those interested in the full experience, we also delve into armored combat, teaching techniques for fighting in historical plate armor.
- **Saber**: Engage in the swift and elegant art of saber fencing, which focuses on the use of a light, curved blade for both cutting and thrusting. Saber fencing combines techniques from cavalry and infantry traditions across Europe, offering a fast-paced and versatile approach to swordsmanship.
- **Staff and Polearms**: Master the techniques of wielding longer weapons such as the quarterstaff, spear, and halberd. These weapons extend your reach on the battlefield and require a unique set of skills for effective use. Training includes understanding leverage, distance, and the mechanics of thrusting and swinging.
- **Dussack**: Immerse yourself in the practice of the dussack, a weapon that simulates the feel of a single-edged, curved sword similar to a saber. The dussack was traditionally used in training for its safety and practicality, offering insights into the mechanics of cut-and-thrust swordsmanship.
- **Smallsword**: Explore the refined techniques of the smallsword, a thrust-oriented weapon that epitomizes the elegance of late Renaissance and Enlightenment-era fencing. Smallsword fencing emphasizes precision, timing, and control, with a focus on the art of the duel.
- **Montante**: Learn the art of the montante or greatsword, a large two-handed sword used for dealing with multiple opponents and controlling wide spaces. The montante's practice involves complex swirling motions and guards, teaching the wielder to maintain momentum while managing distance and positioning.

And from a more modern perspective, we also teach the current sport of fencing, including:
- **Foil**: Discover the precision and agility of foil fencing, a discipline that emphasizes attacks on the torso with the tip of the sword. Foil fencing requires a deep understanding of right of way rules, making it a strategic and fast-paced form of fencing.
- **Épée**: Engage with the épée, the heaviest of the sport fencing weapons, where the entire body is a valid target. This discipline focuses on patience and precision, with no right of way rules, allowing simultaneous hits by both fencers.
- **Sabre**: Experience the dynamic and fast-paced world of sabre fencing, where competitors can score with the edge of the blade as well as the tip. Targeting the upper body, sabre is a test of speed and reflexes, with right of way rules adding a tactical layer to bouts.

## Events and Tournaments

Our group regularly participates in local and national HEMA events and tournaments, offering members the chance to test their skills in a friendly and competitive environment. These events are a fantastic way to meet fellow HEMA practitioners from across South Africa and to promote the growth of historical martial arts in our region.
