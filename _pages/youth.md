## En Garde Youth Fencing Program

Looking for a sport that builds confidence, discipline, and fitness while still being exciting and fun? The En Garde Youth Fencing Program introduces young people to the world of fencing — the Olympic sport of swordplay.

Based in Newlands, Cape Town, our program is designed for children and teens who want to try something different. Fencing develops quick thinking, coordination, and respect, while giving students the thrill of learning a sport rooted in history and tradition.

What the Program Offers

Beginner-friendly classes where kids learn the basics of foil, épée, and sabre in a safe and supportive environment.

Progressive training that grows with your child — from first steps to competitive levels.

Life skills through sport: focus, discipline, respect, and good sportsmanship.

A welcoming community that encourages teamwork, fun, and friendships.

Our youth program is led by experienced coaches who make learning fencing both safe and enjoyable. No prior experience is needed — just bring your energy and curiosity, and we’ll provide the rest.
