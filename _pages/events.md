### Year End Festival 10 December 2023
As the year draws to a close, we celebrate our collective love of Historical European Martial Arts with a fun activity filled festival with an unforgettable dinner. Here the tournament and overall league winners are announced and the floating trophy is handed down from champion to champion.

### Open Day  
Four times a year we host an Open day. Our open days are a perfect time for you to join us! If you want to learn how to swing a sword, you are welcome to come!

The Sports fencing side of the open day will give you an introduction into olympic style fencing. This leads perfectly into the course and training that follows, where you will learn or re-learn old skills and hone your abilities in fencing.

At our HEMA Open Day, you'll have the chance to experience the thrill of historical European martial arts firsthand. Our stalwart instructors will provide demonstrations and introductory workshops on a range of weapons and techniques, from longsword to rapier and dagger. Whether you're a seasoned practitioner or new to HEMA, we welcome you to come and join us for a day of fun, learning, and camaraderie. Don't miss your chance to explore the world of historical swordsmanship!

Cost is: **R70.00**
Contact David to book your spot!

### League Nights

At the end of each term we set aside a day to test our skills in a series of league matches. This is a perfect oppurtunity to see how far you have come and to apply your hard won skills against your fellow fencers.

This term there are a number of League events happening! Spectators are welcome!
